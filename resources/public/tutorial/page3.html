  Excellent, now let's learn about the different parts of the query. The simplest query just has a <code>START</code> and
  <code>RETURN</code> clause. <code>START</code> let's you assign nodes selections to identifiers and <code>return</code> 
  declares which tabular results you expect back.
</p>
<p>
  For <code>START</code> there are two main options, direct ID access with <code>START n=node(id)</code> or index lookup
  with <code>START n=node:index(key="value")</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Try them out. 
</p>

<p>Once you're finished playing around, try <code class="expr">START n=node(1,2) return n.name</code>.</p>
